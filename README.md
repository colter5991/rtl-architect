# rtl-architect
Automatic verilog code generation

# Why?

Because tools should enable us, not get in the way.
Because hardware designers waste too much time doing repetitious tasks.
Because fixing bugs generated while using current hardware tools is the most time-consuming part of building hardware.
Because while the software community has developed mature programming tools, hardware designers are still tolerating the frustrating tools of 10 years ago.
*Because building hardware shouldn't be so hard.*
